  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Professional REST API for sports management system with content negotiation via Accept headers.
    
    ## Design Principles
    
    ### Content Negotiation
    Uses Accept headers to control resource representations:
    - `application/vnd.api.{resource}.full+json` - Complete data with all fields
    - `application/vnd.api.{resource}.detail+json` - Extended data without readonly fields
    - `application/vnd.api.{resource}.summary+json` - Minimal data (id, name, email)
    - `application/json` - Fallback to full representation
    
    ### Schema Naming Conventions
    Follows industry-standard DTO naming patterns:
    - **{Resource}** - Full response model (GET)
    - **{Resource}Summary** - Minimal response model (GET with summary Accept)
    - **{Resource}Detail** - Extended response model (GET with detail Accept)
    - **{Resource}Create** - Request model for resource creation (POST)
    - **{Resource}Update** - Request model for full replacement (PUT)
    - **{Resource}Patch** - Request model for partial update (PATCH)
    
    ### HTTP Method Semantics
    - **GET** - Retrieve (idempotent, safe)
    - **POST** - Create (non-idempotent, returns 201 + Location header)
    - **PUT** - Full replacement (idempotent, requires all fields)
    - **PATCH** - Partial update (non-idempotent, optional fields)
    - **DELETE** - Remove (idempotent, returns 204)
